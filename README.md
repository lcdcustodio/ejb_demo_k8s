EJB Demo over Kubernetes
===========


Deploying Enterprise JavaBeans application over Kubernetes cluster. For achieving the aim is mandatory to follow containerization approach. For this purposes was considered WildFly Docker image. It is required also a Kubernetes Cluster up and running.  


------------

1- High Level Design
===========================


![Alt text](/picture/hld.png "Solution Architecture")


------------

2- Installation
===========================

First of all, letâ€™s clone the repository and build the application:

```
    git clone https://github.com/lcdcustodio/ejb_demo_k8s.git
    cd ejb_demo_k8s
    mvn clean install
```    

Once the Maven build is finished, the deployment archive has been created in target folder. Now, we be able to create images required for Pods in the Solution Architecture.  

```
    # EJB image
    docker build -t ejb_demo_k8s .
    # NGINX image
    docker build -f deploy/Dockerfile -t nginx_soap_script .    

```    


------------

3- Kubernetes resources assembly 
===========================

Yaml files in charge to create all of kubernetes resources for this demo are available at deploy folder. Through the Kubernetes command-line tool, kubectl, let's run the following instructions:  

```
    # create deployment, pod and replicaset for EJB application
    kubectl apply -f .\deploy\deployment.yaml
    # create service for EJB application
    kubectl apply -f .\deploy\service.yaml
    # create NGINX pod
    kubectl apply -f .\deploy\pod-nginx.yaml
```    

------------

4- Kubernetes Logs 
===========================


- kubectl get services # get service info
- kubectl get deployments # get deployment info
- kubectl get rs # get replicaset info
- kubectl get pods -o wide  # get pod info
- kubectl describe service svc-ejb-demo-k8s #endpoint address to load balance
- kubectl logs -f pod-nginx #soap script is up and running

------------

5- Check load balancing between pods
===========================

- kubectl logs -f <pod_name> #pods created from deployment 

------------

6- Use Case - check pod resiliency 
===========================

#
- kubectl get pods -o wide  # get pods info
- kubectl delete pods --all  #pods will be back, except pod-nginx
- kubectl delete pods <pod_name> # pod downtime is really fast.. s
- kubectl get pods -o wide  # get pods info
